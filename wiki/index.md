# Who

`#mcdevs` is a loose group of developers working on projects that are directly
or indirectly related to the popular indie hit, [Minecraft][].

There is no process to join mcdevs nor any official member list. There are
no responsibilities so long as you follow the [community rules](/irc/rules).
Individuals who have been around for an extended period of time and have
proven to be mature and helpful are identified by voice (`+Vv`) in the IRC
channel.

## Where

`#mcdevs` gathers in the IRC channel `#mcdevs` on [irc.freenode.net][]. Please
follow the [channel rules](/irc/rules). We have a core group of about 100
members and rarely need to ban people. Please don't be the exception.

## Group Projects

Occasionally, multiple members will get together to create or maintain a
project or resource.

wiki.vg
:   One of the core projects of `#mcdevs` is [wiki.vg][], the primary
    development wiki for [Minecraft][] and the home of the Minecraft
    protocol specifications.

b.wiki.vg
:   [Burger][], is set of tools for disassembling the minecraft
    binaries and producing a JSON description of items, entities, packets,
    and other internels useful to developers. [b.wiki.vg][] makes these
    available automatically and supports a `diff` between two different
    versions.
